# Welcome to my introduction project

I'm glad that you are here! It means that you are curious about my Flutter skills.

In this project I would like to present my Flutter knowledge to better understand my skills, experiences
and capabilities.

This project is a simple timer application that use the sleek_circular_slider pub dependency to show a timer.
Within this project I'd like to show that I understand the most of Flutter tools, utilities and concepts.

## How does it look?

## Start the project

This project is optimised for Flutter 3.22.3 so I highly recommend to use the pushed SDK version from the repository.

You can install the [fvm](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started) and after that you can run easily the project by running the ```fvm flutter run``` command.

## Tests
I wrote a few tests, based on the coverage report(run the ```rps test coverage``` script in the root and it will generate and open automatically the coverage report as well) the repo reached the 90% of test coverage. 
Feel free to check my tests.

To activate rps run the following command ```dart pub global activate rps --version 0.8.0```
