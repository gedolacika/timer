# Welcome to my introduction project

I'm glad that you are here! It means that you are curious about my Flutter skills.

In this project I would like to present my Flutter knowledge to better understand my skills, experiences
and capabilities.

This project is a simple timer application that use the sleek_circular_slider pub dependency to show a timer.
Within this project I'd like to show that I understand the most of Flutter tools, utilities and concepts.

## How does it look?


## Start the project

This project is optimised for Flutter 3.22.3 so I highly recommend to use the pushed SDK version from the repository.

You can install the [fvm](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started) and after that you can run easily the project by running the ```fvm flutter run``` command.
